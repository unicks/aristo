Let f: A → B and g: B → C be functions.  Is it always true that...?\n(a) If g is injective, then g◦f is injective.\n(b) If f is injective, then g◦f is injective.\n(c) If f is injective, then g◦f is injective if g is injective.\n\n3. Let A, B, and C be sets, and let f: A → B, g: A → B, h: B → C, and i: B → C be functions.\n(a) If h is injective, then h◦f = h◦g implies f = g.\n(b) If h is not injective, then h◦f = h◦g implies f = g.\n(c) If f is surjective, then h◦f = i◦f implies h = i.\n\n4. Let f: A → B be a function and D be a subset of B.\n(a) Prove that f(f−1(D)) ⊆ D.\n(b) Prove that f−1(f(D)) ⊇ D.\n(c) Complete the sentence: \"f is _____ if and only if f−1(f(D)) = D.\"\nJustify your answer.\n\n5.
